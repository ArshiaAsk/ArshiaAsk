## Hi there 👋

I'm an Economics undergraduate passionate about using data science and machine learning to understand markets and solve real-world problems.
I work with Python to analyze time series, perform econometric modeling (EViews & Python), and build ML/DL models for price prediction and automation.
Currently building real projects in forecasting, economic analysis, and AI-powered Telegram bots.
I believe in learning by doing — and this GitHub is where I document that journey.

🔍 Interests: Data analysis • Econometrics • Deep learning • AI applications in economics
🧠 Tools: Python, EViews, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Git
