ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arshia

As a passionate economics student and aspiring data scientist, I blend the analytical mindset of economics with the power of programming and machine learning to understand patterns, forecast markets, and build real-world solutions.
My journey began with statistical analysis and econometrics, but it quickly evolved into coding, modeling, and developing end-to-end data projects using Python and modern data tools.

Through hands-on experience, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in time series analysis, economic forecasting, and building ML/DL models. Iâ€™ve worked on projects like gold price prediction using ARIMA and deep learning, analyzing oil and dollar market impacts, and creating AI-driven Telegram bots. My goal is to turn ideas into working systems that create value and insight.

ðŸ“Œ 
Iâ€™m currently building projects that connect data science with economics â€” from econometric models in EViews and Python, to machine learning models deployed in real tools. Iâ€™m also preparing to expand my freelance career and contribute to impactful data projects in startups and research.

ðŸ’¡
I love solving complex, messy problems with code. Whether itâ€™s forecasting economic variables, designing a machine learning pipeline, or automating tasks with bots, I enjoy crafting practical solutions and learning in public.
I also care deeply about clean, readable code, experiment-driven learning, and understanding the why behind every model or algorithm I use.
