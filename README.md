## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 connecting economics with data science to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems.

Over the past two years, I've built a solid foundation in statistics, econometrics, and Python programming. I've used tools like EViews and Python for time series analysis, economic forecasting, and regression modeling. Recently, Iâ€™ve expanded into machine learning and deep learning, working on real projects like gold price prediction, oil market analysis, and AI-powered Telegram bots.

ðŸ”§ I enjoy designing end-to-end data projects â€” from data cleaning and exploration to modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Whether it's building an ARIMA model to forecast prices or training neural networks for automation, I strive to make my code both functional and meaningful.

ðŸ“Œ My GitHub is where I document my learning, projects, experiments, and tools that Iâ€™m building along the way. I believe in learning by doing and in building a portfolio that reflects real progress and curiosit

ðŸ§° Tools & Tech I Use:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels)

EViews, Excel

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Git & GitHub
